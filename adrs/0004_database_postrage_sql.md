## 1. Database Engine Selection
### Decision
We have decided to use PostgreSQL as the database engine for this project.

### Implementation Steps
1. Integrate PostgreSQL into the project by adding the necessary database driver dependencies.
2. Create the required database schema and tables.
3. Update the project configuration to connect to the PostgreSQL database.

### Considerations
- Pros:
  - PostgreSQL is known for its reliability, performance, and advanced features.
  - It has strong support for complex queries, transactions, and data integrity.
  - Active open-source community and regular updates.

- Cons:
  - Implementing PostgreSQL may involve a learning curve for effective management and configuration
