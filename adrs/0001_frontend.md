## 1. Choose Frontend Technology Stack
### Decision
We have decided to use Django for both backend and frontend development in the "Losuj To" app. HTML templates, will be utilized for creating the user interface.

### Implementation Steps
1. Integrate HTML templates into Django views for rendering.
2. Organize frontend assets using Django's static files structure.
3. Ensure consistent styling and responsive design using template components.

### Considerations
- Pros: Consistent development experience, seamless integration with Django, and ease of use with Bootstrap.
- Cons: Limited flexibility compared to a dedicated frontend library/framework.
